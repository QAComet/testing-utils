# About

This repository contains commonly used utility methods and functionality used across playwright testing projects. The code in this project is just a collection of common design patterns which I'm sure are replicated across many different projects, in many different variations. This is here so I don't have to worry about (potential) IP conflicts since everything here is MIT licensed without attribution.
